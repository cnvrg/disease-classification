title: disease classification # required on creation, a slug will be generated from the title? -> inference-library
version: 0.0.1 # required
description: "classify images and metadata" # optional
icon: python # optional

# Optional properties for crediting authors
author: "cnvrg"
author_email: "info@cnvrg.io"

# At least one tag [inference, training, data] must be present
tags:
  - training
  - connector
  - data

# Available only for training (exec tasks) libraries only
command: python3 disease_classification.py

# These will replace the "compute" argument, values must be >= 0:
# We need to add requirement for distributed pods
requirements:
  cpu: 2
  memory: 2
  gpu: 0
  hpu: 0

# This will replace the "docker_images" argument (?) need to work in cnvrg as well
image: python:3.8

language: python3

arguments:
  # Training arguments will have type and value, valid types are [discrete, float, integer, categorical]
  # Empty value will mark the argument as 'required', adding a default value will place it in the flow.
